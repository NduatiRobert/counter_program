# counter_program
This simple counter program utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a visual counter that can be incremented and decremented with button clicks.

Files
index.html: Contains the main HTML structure, including the counter display and buttons.
style.css: Provides basic styling for the counter's visual appearance.
script.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Increment" button to increase the counter's value.
Click the "Decrement" button to decrease the counter's value.
Click the "Reset" button to set the counter back to zero.
Features
Visual counter display: The current count is prominently displayed on the page.
Interactive buttons: Users can intuitively interact with the counter using the provided buttons.
Reset functionality: The counter can be easily reset to its initial state.
Basic styling: The counter's appearance is enhanced with simple CSS styling for better readability.
Potential Enhancements
Customizable starting value: Allow users to set a custom initial count.
Counter range restrictions: Implement options to limit the counter's minimum and maximum values.
Visual feedback on button clicks: Provide visual cues (e.g., color changes) to indicate button presses.
Enhanced styling: Expand the visual design with more elaborate CSS styles for a personalized look and feel.
Troubleshooting
If the counter does not increment or decrement, ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
If the styling appears incorrect, check the style.css file for any errors or conflicts.
Additional Notes
This program is intended for basic demonstration purposes.
It provides a foundation for exploring JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation techniques.
